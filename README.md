# Clothing Storefront

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.6. I am learning Angular v17 by creating a fictional clothing store application to explore its capabilities.

## What I've Learned

### Angular Foundations

- **Angular Architecture**: Understanding the structure and design of Angular applications, including components, directives, and services.
- **Standalone Components**: Learning how to create reusable components without the need for a parent module.
- **Modules**: Organizing the application into logical units.
- **Routing**: Setting up navigation and routing between components.
- **Pipes & Services**: Utilizing built-in pipes and creating custom services to manage shared logic and data.

## Development Server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code Scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running Unit Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running End-to-End Tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further Help
